# MeioScope

This repository contains some supplementary materials for the manuscript "Changes in synapsis dynamics accompany variation in meiotic stability in Arabidopsis arenosa autotetraploids" by Gonzalo et al. In case of any question of inquiry contact Adrian Gonzalo (adrian.gonzalo@biol.ethz.ch).

There are thre types of files uploaded here:

-Fiji macros: used to analyze meiocites . These macros are designed to be applied to large image sets using the batch analysis option of Fiji. They can be applied by copy-pasting the code in the batch analysis options window.

-R scripts: Used to analyze cytogenetic data including the output of the Fiji macros.

-Raw datasets: The files required to reproduce the same analyses shown in the manuscript.
